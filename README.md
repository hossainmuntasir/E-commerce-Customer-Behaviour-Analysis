### Project Overview: E-commerce Customer Behavior Analysis

This project delves into the exploration and analysis of e-commerce customer behavior data. Utilizing a dataset named "ecommerce_customer_data.csv," which encapsulates various aspects of customer interactions such as browsing time, pages viewed, items added to cart, and total purchases, the study aims to uncover insights into consumer behavior patterns and preferences.

Key Objectives:
1. **Data Understanding and Cleaning**: Initial examination of the dataset to understand the structure, followed by cleaning and preprocessing steps to ensure data quality for analysis.
2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculation of summary statistics for both numeric and categorical variables to grasp basic trends and distributions within the data.
3. **Visualization**: Employing libraries like Plotly and Matplotlib to create interactive charts and histograms. These visualizations include age distribution, gender distribution, product browsing time vs. total pages viewed, and device usage patterns, providing a graphical representation of customer behavior and engagement.
4. **Segmentation Analysis**: Introduction of Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) as a metric to segment customers into groups such as Low Value, Medium Value, and High Value. This segmentation helps in identifying the most profitable customer groups for targeted marketing strategies.
5. **Funnel Analysis**: Construction of a conversion funnel to understand how customers move through the purchasing process, identifying drop-off points and potential areas for improvement to enhance conversion rates.
6. **Churn Rate Calculation**: Determination of the churn rate to measure the percentage of customers who do not make any purchases, offering insights into customer retention challenges.

The project employs Python for data manipulation and analysis, leveraging powerful libraries to perform statistical calculations, generate meaningful visualizations, and draw actionable insights. The ultimate goal is to empower e-commerce businesses with data-driven strategies to optimize their marketing efforts, improve customer engagement, and maximize profitability.
